# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
### Introduction
#### You work for a company called PyBer that provides rides to people in a number of cities. The company was started by an individual name V. Isualize who has a history in data analytics and vizualization. 
### Challenge
#### In your position at PyBer, you have been selected to give a presentation to V. Isualize. This presentation will look at the different factors that affect the populairty and sales of PyBer rides. Factors such as number of drivers, city type, and average fares will be looked at and presented to V. Isualize. 
## Results
#### The overall totals for each of the different types of citites can be seen below including the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver.

#### The results were divided into 3 different types of citites; Urban, Suburban, and Rural. When looking at the percentage of rides per city type it was found that urban citites had the highest percentage of rides. Urban citites made up 68.4% of rides with suburban is following with 26.3% and the rural last with only 5.3% of rides. This can be seen in the following image.

##### The total number of drivers per city also followed a similar pattern as the previous cateogry. Urban drivers made up 80.9% of the drivers with Suburban at 16.5% and rural with 2.6%.

#### We then also looked to see what the percentage of total fares were comprised up by different citites. As similar to before Urban led with 62.&% of the total fares. Suburban followed with 30.5% and rural was the least amount with 6.8%

#### The following graph shows the total fare by city type over the span of a couple of months.

## Analysis
#### There are a couple of reccomendations that I would make to the CEO in order to address the disparities that we are able to see. 
1. When looking at the total fares by city type over a period of time we are able to see that urban and suburban cities tend to have lower fares in the beginning of the year. It may be beneficial to have some extra marketing or deals during that time of the year to boost sales. 
2. The Urban citite smake up 68.4% of the total rides but they only make up 62.7% of the total fares. It might be beneficial to have higher rates in the urban cities because there is a greater want for rides but they do not statisitcally charge as much.
3. 80.9% of drivers are in the urban cities while thet only make up 68.4% of the actual rides. It might be beneficial to move some of the drivers into the other city types which might help to decrease the competition within urban drivers which would increase the fares. It would also help to boost some sales within the other city types.
